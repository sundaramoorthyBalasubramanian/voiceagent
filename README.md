Set up an end-to-end voice agent that only understands and speaks in PigLatin. If the user says in normal english, the agent should correct it and say 'orrysay , easeplay eakspay inyay igpay atinlay, iyay annotcay understandyay otherwiseyay' (Sorry, please speak in pig latin, I cannot understand otherwise). Apart from the PigLatin speech, there should be a web interface where we can tune:

- The voice of the agent

- The prosody of the voice (speed and tone)

- Add background noises to make the conversation feel natural. (We can select from two available background noises.)
